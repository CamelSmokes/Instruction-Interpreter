# Interpreter Experiment

This is an experiment at creating an mid level instruction interpreter for a sequence of instructions.
High level concepts like arrays, strings and variables can be operated on with the same ease as primitives like Booleans or integers.

The use case for this would be to have a higher level language which is then at runtime compiled down to the instructions read and executedby this interpreter.
